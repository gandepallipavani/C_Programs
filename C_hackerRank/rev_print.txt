This challenge is part of a tutorial track by MyCodeSchool and is accompanied by a video lesson.

Given a pointer to the head of a singly-linked list, print each  value from the reversed list. If the given list is empty, do not print anything.

Example

 refers to the linked list with  values 

Print the following:
3
2
1

Function Description

Complete the reversePrint function in the editor below.

reversePrint has the following parameters:

SinglyLinkedListNode pointer head: a reference to the head of the list
Prints

The  values of each node in the reversed list.

Input Format

The first line of input contains , the number of test cases.

The input of each test case is as follows:

The first line contains an integer , the number of elements in the list.
Each of the next n lines contains a data element for a list node.
Constraints

, where  is the  element in the list.

Explanation

There are three test cases. There are no blank lines between test case output.

The first linked list has  elements: 16 -> 12->4->2->5. Printing this in reverse order produces:
5
2
4
12
16

The second linked list has  elements:7->3->9->NULL . Printing this in reverse order produces:
9
3
7
The third linked list has  elements: 5->1->18->3->13->NULL. Printing this in reverse order produces:
13
3
18
1
5



Logic:::


void reversePrint(SinglyLinkedListNode* head) {
    SinglyLinkedListNode* last = NULL;
    while(head != NULL) {
        SinglyLinkedListNode* temp =(SinglyLinkedListNode*)malloc(sizeof(SinglyLinkedListNode));
        temp->data = head->data;
        temp->next = last;
        last = temp;
        head = head->next;
    }
    
    while(last != NULL) {
        printf("%d\n",last->data);
        last = last->next;
    }

}
